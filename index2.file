The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol implements an application-layer network protocol used to access resources on a server, such as file shares and shared printers.

NOTE
In the context of SMB, you can find mentions about the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which is a dialect of SMB. Both the SMB and CIFS protocol are supported, and the kernel module and utilities involved in mounting SMB and CIFS shares both use the name cifs.
